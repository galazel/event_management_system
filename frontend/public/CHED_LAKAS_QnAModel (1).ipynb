For some reasons, that the government is delayed in distributing the funds for other universities including PSU, OIGP provides a significant help in maintaining and continuing the university goals. These projects provide essential services to the PSU community and generate revenue to support the university's operations and programs.Currently, the sales data is not very efficiently managed at PSU-OIGP and it is causing problems with accuracy and timeliness of records. The sales data is collected manually from the cashiers and then passed along to the accounting and finally to the director. This process takes about seven days which causes delays in the availability of the sales data. Also, the manual handling of data increases the chance of errors, which can cause even more delays in the decision-making process. That is why the proponent needs to find an automated and efficient solution to streamline the sales tracking process, which will improve efficiency, accuracy, and financial sustainability. Specifically, the major problems of the PSU-OIGP are the following:Sales reports take a long time to reach the director Inability to check sales data during the director’s busy period Inconsistent system integration Untimely daily sales report The tedious procedure of making an adjustment to the sales reports To ensure that their sales records are accurate and timely, it is important to have a unified sales tracking system. With an automated system, they can be used to make quick decisions and maintain the university's income-generated finances monitoring easily with less errors and delays. Additionally, the system will make it simpler to handle sales data, identify patterns, and maintain efficiency.\\\"\"\n",
